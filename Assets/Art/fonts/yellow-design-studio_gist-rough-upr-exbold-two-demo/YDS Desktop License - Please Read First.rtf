\b\fs28 DETAILED DESCRIPTION\
1. Number of users
\fs36 \

\fs26 The maximum number of users of this font/fonts is limited to ONE. It is unlawful to distribute this font to ANY ADDITIONAL USERS.
\b0  \
This license allows ONE simultaneous use on a maximum of 5 devices at one site for use on a single platform. A device is defined as a computer, printer, character generator, server or any other machine that uses font data to rasterize letterforms. A site is defined as one physical location. Platform refers to operating systems designated as \'91Macintosh\'92, \'91Windows\'92 or other. All users must belong to the same company or household purchasing the font.\
A laptop may be one of the devices in the basic license of 5 devices as long as the laptop is associated primarily with the licensed location. Simply working offsite on a laptop is permissible in the basic license and is regarded as an extension of the \'93site\'94. Work transported from one distinct network to another distinct network, via a laptop requires each network to be licensed properly.\
To obtain a multiple user license for TWO OR MORE simultaneous users, please contact ryan@yellowdesignstudio.com.\
